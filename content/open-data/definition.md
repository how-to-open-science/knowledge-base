# What makes open data open?

According to the [**Open Definition**](https://opendefinition.org/od/2.1/en/),
> Knowledge is open if anyone is free to access, use, modify, and share it — subject, at most, to measures that preserve provenance and openness.

The [**FAIR principles**](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) provide guidelines to make data more **f**indable, **a**ccessible, **i**nteroperable, and **r**eusable.
